# My short story
## The reason why I study computers every day <br><br>

### The reason why I study computers every day is because I like computers, my major is cybersecurity, or the trend changes quickly, so I have to study every day to keep up, That reason is correct. But I also have a slightly different reason. <br><br>

### When I told you my short story, I started studying computers when I was younger than I thought. So I thought I was better at computers than others. This was my most embarrassing and profound misunderstanding. <br><br>

### The reason why I reflected on myself and started studying was because I took on a big project at university. At that time, I felt like I could do anything, and everything was going better than I thought. <br><br>

### However, the incident started because of my short-tempered behavior and my mistakes caused the team members to start over again. Also, I was disappointed and traumatized by the mistake. I was afraid of servers and the web, so I kept avoiding them. <br><br>

### So I started studying Forensics, which I liked and enjoyed, and the simple idea was that it was actually less risky than web hacking and other security. <br><br>

### However, while studying forensics, I thought forensics was more professional and difficult than any other field. However, I can't deny that Forensics is my favorite track because it's fun. <br><br>

### Simply put, I've lost control of the Web and servers because of the trauma, and as a computer user, it's a shame and a bottom-up. I really shouldn't have done this, but I was too busy avoiding it because I was scared soon after I went out into society. <br><br>

### Oh, and most importantly, I thought it was shameful to think I was good at it and show my poor performance to others. In fact, this article is the most embarrassing thing to see later, but on the other hand, I think it shows the most self-reflection and growth." <br><br>

### However, I thought it would be inevitable and something that I had to overcome someday. So I thought, "When I thought about why I was afraid and avoided it, I didn't study because I didn't have enough foundations." <br><br>

### So I decided to study little by little every day. I began to study. Then I learned to understand one by one, gained confidence, and now I can study again in various fields. <br><br>

### If you make a big mistake and you're scared, I think it's a good way to grow up by studying little by little without avoiding it. Don't be too afraid. Anyone makes a mistake and falls. <br><br>

### I started blogging and GitHub to share what I've learned little by little and to see it again later when I can't remember, but now it's a really good way to study and it's not traumatized. <br><br>

### Recently, however, I still need a lot of study, so I shouldn't be conceited, and I always try to study slowly and steadily from the beginning. <br><br>

### I think everyone will understand if you study steadily without telling others that you are good. Today's article reminds me of the last time and I wrote it briefly. Now that I think about it, I feel better because I feel like I've grown a lot more than I did then.
