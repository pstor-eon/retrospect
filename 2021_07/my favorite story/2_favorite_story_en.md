1. ### __Lord, grant me the best of what I can do, give me the courage to resign from what I can't, and give me the wisdom to tell the two apart..__
    - Although this article is religious, it is true that it is a really good article for me. I think it takes courage to do what I can to do my best, and to give up and give up on things I can't do. If I keep going because I think I can do a little bit more, one day I can go on a road of no return. So giving up seems to be courage and strength. So I guess that's why I like this article. Giving up is an act of courage, not shame. But do the best you can.<br><br>

2. ### __The important thing is not to give up. Don't worry about slowing down, worry about stopping.__
    - As I said in the last article, it is important not to give up. Of course, as in the article above, giving up on something I can't do is also courage. But if it's something I can do and it's something I like, it's better to never give up and go to the end. It is okay to be slow, so if you run slowly and steadily, you will see the desired results.<br><br>

3. ### __Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right. <u>-Henry Ford-</u>__
    - What you believe will come true.<br><br>

4. ### __Difficulty and exhaustion are evidence of hard work Having a slump is evidence of enthusiasm Failing is evidence of challenge Being nervous is evidence of sincerity Whether or not to quit is evidence of not giving up hope.__
    - Of course, you shouldn't be rationalizing yourself, but if you do your best and read this article, you will know what your situation is. I don't know who wrote this article, but I saw it on the internet. I saw it during a really difficult time, so I wrote it down on a notepad.<br><br>

5. ### __believe in yourself.__
    - This article is just what I usually say to myself. The moment you start doubting whether you can do something before starting something, it becomes difficult to proceed. But the moment I thought I could do it, I was able to do many things without regretting it.<br><br>

6. ### __멋지게 살자.__
    - 멋지게 살고 싶다.<br><br>

7. ### __"You can fail at what you don't want? <u>-Jim Carrey-</u>"__
    - These are the words of famous actor Jim Carrey. For example, it might be good if you get a job at a place that gives you a lot of money, or if you get a job in the department you went to because you got a good job, but you may fail. So he might be better off living happily doing what he loves.<br><br>

8. ### __Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine. <u>The Imitaion Game</u>__
    - If you've seen the imitation game movie, it's a line that will remain in your heart for a long time. Come to think of it, sometimes quiet people do something. So we shouldn't ignore people who can't do anything right now.<br><br>

9. ### __Don't confuse failure once with failure forever. <u>-Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald</u>__
    - In life, there will be days when you fall and there are days when you run. But just because we fall every time doesn't mean we've failed forever. You should know this well. I need to know if I fell once or if I didn't get up.<br><br>

10. ### __If you are not happy today, you will not be happy forever.__
    - <br><br>

11. ### __Fear can be overcome with simple and stupid courage.__
    - In fact, once I start, my fears and worries can be resolved to some extent. this is undoubtedly true.<br><br>

12. ### __There can be no fear without hope and there can be no hope without fear. <u>-Baruch Spinoza-</u>__
    -
